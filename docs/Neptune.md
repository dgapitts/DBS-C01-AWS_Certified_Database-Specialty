### Neptune supports the following graph query languages to access a graph:

* Gremlin, defined by Apache TinkerPop for creating and querying property graphs. A query in Gremlin is a traversal made up of discrete steps, each of which follows an edge to a node.
*  openCypher is a declarative query language for property graphs that was originally developed by Neo4j, then open-sourced in 2015, and contributed to the openCypher project under an Apache 2 open-source license. Its syntax is documented in the openCypher spec.
* SPARQL is a declarative language based on graph pattern-matching, for querying RDF data. It is supported by the World Wide Web Consortium.
